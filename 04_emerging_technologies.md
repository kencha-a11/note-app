# BlockChain


## Purpose

The main purpose of blockchain is to act as a secure, decentralized, and tamper-resistant digital ledger that records and verifies transactions or data across a distributed network, removing the need for a single controlling authority.

## Usage

- **In Education**:  

  Blockchain is used in education to securely issue and verify academic credentials. Platforms like **Blockcerts** enable institutions to provide tamper-proof digital diplomas and certificates, which can be verified anywhere without intermediaries. **MIT’s Digital Diploma** project uses blockchain to offer graduates secure, portable proof of their achievements. Similarly, **OpenBlockChain**, developed by the UK’s Open University and British Telecom, issues verifiable **Open Badges** for MOOCs and microcredentials. Other initiatives include blockchain-based credentialing systems from Sony Global Education and universities such as the University of Nicosia.

- **In IT**:  

  Blockchain is leveraged in IT for secure data management, decentralized identity systems, and transparent transaction logging. **Hyperledger Fabric** provides a modular blockchain framework used by enterprises for supply chain tracking, secure document sharing, and business process automation. **Ethereum-based smart contracts** enable automated, trustless execution of agreements without intermediaries. In cybersecurity, blockchain’s immutable ledger helps detect and prevent data tampering, while decentralized authentication systems reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized servers.

## Examples


- **In Education**:  

  **Blockcerts** is a blockchain-based platform for issuing secure, verifiable academic credentials. In Georgia Tech’s 2018 usability study, students used a Blockcerts prototype to receive and share digital diplomas, revealing that while the system ensures tamper-proof verification, adoption depends on improving usability, reducing technical jargon, and streamlining credential delivery.

- **In IT**:  

  **Etherisc** targets flight insurance, allowing travelers to purchase coverage for flight delays or cancellations. Its blockchain-based smart contracts automatically check flight status via trusted data sources and trigger payouts instantly if conditions are met eliminating the need for manual claims, reducing administrative costs, and increasing transparency for both insurers and customers.
